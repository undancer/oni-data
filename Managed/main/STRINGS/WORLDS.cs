		public static class SANDSTONE_FROZEN
		{
			public static LocString NAME = "Rime";

			public static LocString DESCRIPTION = "A frigid location marked by inhospitably low temperatures throughout.\n\n<smallcaps>Rime's low temperatures will make finding water and establishing farms or ranches problematic. However, the wide spectrum of minerals and cool environment could lead to thriving industry.</smallcaps>\n\n";

			public static LocString DESCRIPTION = "A lush location rich in wildlife and life-sustaining resources.\n\n<smallcaps>Establishing a foothold on Verdante will be challenging due to reduced food and oxygen options.

		{
			public static LocString NAME = "Oasisse";

			public static LocString DESCRIPTION = "A desolate location with a cache of life-sustaining water trapped beneath the surface.\n\n<smallcaps>A wide underground desert will pose temperature threats and strain the resources of a colony on Oasisse. However, surviving the challenge should present great industrial opportunities.</smallcaps>\n\n";

		public static class OCEANIA
		{
			public static LocString NAME = "Oceania";

			public static LocString DESCRIPTION = "A location with vast quantities of unpotable salt water.\n\n<smallcaps>Oceania is quite stable and resource rich, but the majority of the area is covered in a saltwater ocean. Careful expansion and resource usage should lead to a successful colony.</smallcaps>\n\n";
